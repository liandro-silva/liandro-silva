Hi, how are you? Welcome to my GitHub profile. I've been working in software development for **almost 3 years**, with experience in various market segments such as **E-learning, Customer Experience, Finance, Accounting, Logistics, and Healthcare**. My work covers all stages of application development, from requirements analysis to deployment.

Currently, I am working as a Packaged App Development Senior Analyst at [@accenture.](https://www.accenture.com/br-pt)

I work at a leading pharmaceutical retail company in Brazil. My main focus is on React and React Native development.

Currently, I'm excited about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and I intend to work with it professionally.
